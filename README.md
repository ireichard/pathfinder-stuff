# Helpful Pathfinder Roll20 Macros
#### I play pathfinder a lot with friends, here's some helpful macros i've made that might be useful for someone else.

These macros are built for the [Official Pathfinder Sheet by Roll20](https://wiki.roll20.net/Pathfinder_Official).

**I use .macro files to specify macros, .ability files to specify abilities.**

Macros:
Go to Collection tab > Macros +Add > Name it what you want, paste code. 

Abilities:
Go to Character Sheet > Attributes and Abilities > Abilities +Add > Name it what you want, paste code.

***Important***

**If you copy code with html entity replacements, you may need to copy/paste it again if you want to edit it.**

I personally recommend viewing raw so copy/paste becomes easier.
